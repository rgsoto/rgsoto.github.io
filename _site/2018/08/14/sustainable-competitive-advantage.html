      <p>“The ability to learn faster than our competitors may be the only sustainable competitive advantage.”</p>

<p>It seems like the world, and by extension our business is changing so fast and getting faster that you’d be forgiven for getting whiplash. So how do we better prepare ourselves for a future where the only guarantees are uncertainty and ever-increasing speed?</p>

<p>By resisting the bias against doing new things, scanning the horizon for growth opportunities, and pushing yourself to acquire radically different capabilities - all while still doing your job. That requires a willingness to experiment and become a novice again and again: an extremely discomforting notion for most of us. Thankfully, the author in the article I’m covering has come across people who succeed at this kind of learning. There are four key attributes important to learning</p>

<p>Aspiration: It’s easy to see aspiration as either there or not: You want to learn a new skill or you don’t; you have ambition and motivation or you lack them. But great learners can raise their aspiration level—and that’s key, because everyone is guilty of sometimes resisting development that is critical to success.</p>

<p>Think about the last time your company adopted a new approach—Like Agile, or overhauled a reporting system. Were we eager to go along? Our initial response was probably to justify not learning. (It will take too long. The old way works just fine for me. I bet it’s just a flash in the pan.) When confronted with new learning, this is often our first roadblock: We focus on the negative and unconsciously reinforce our lack of aspiration. Researchers have found that shifting your focus from challenges to benefits is a good way to increase your aspiration to do initially unappealing things.</p>

<p>Self-awareness: When it comes to the need for learning, our assessments of ourselves—what we know and don’t know, skills we have and don’t have—can still be woefully inaccurate. In one study conducted by David Dunning, a Cornell University psychologist - found that 94% of college professors reported that they were doing “above average work.” Clearly, almost half were wrong—many extremely so—and their self-deception surely diminished any appetite for development. Only 6% of respondents saw themselves as having a lot to learn about being an effective teacher. Accept that our perspective is often biased or flawed and then strive for greater objectivity, which leaves us much more open to hearing and acting on others’ opinions.</p>

<p>The trick is to pay attention to how we talk to ourselves about ourselves and then question the validity of that “self-talk.” Our inner voice is most useful when it reports the facts of a situation in a balanced way. It should serve as a “fair witness” so that we’re open to seeing the areas in which you could improve and how to do so.</p>

<p>Curiosity: Carol Sansone, a psychology researcher, has found, that people can increase their willingness to tackle necessary tasks by thinking about how they could do the work differently to make it more interesting. In other words, they change their self-talk from This is boring to I wonder if I could…?</p>

<p>We can employ the same strategy in our working life by noticing the language we use in thinking about things that already interest us —How…? Why…? I wonder…?—and drawing on it when we need to become curious. Then take just one step to answer a question you’ve asked yourself.</p>

<p>The next time we’re asked to learn something at the office, or sense that we should because colleagues are doing so, we should encourage ourselves to ask and answer a few curious questions about it—Why are others so excited about this? How might this make my job easier?—and then seek out the answers. We’ll need to find just one thing about a “boring” topic that sparks our curiosity.</p>

<p>Vulnerability: Once we become good or even excellent at some things, we rarely want to go back to being not good at other things. Yes, we’re now taught to embrace experimentation and “fast failure” at work. But we’re also taught to play to our strengths. So the idea of being bad at something for weeks or months; feeling awkward and slow; having to ask “I-don’t-know-what-you’re-talking-about” questions; and needing step-by-step guidance again and again is extremely scary. Great learners allow themselves to be vulnerable enough to accept that beginner state. In fact, they become reasonably comfortable in it. One of the benefits of this type of thinking when in the process of acquiring new skills is “heightened interest, persistence, and better performance.”</p>

<p>The ability to acquire new skills and knowledge quickly and continually is crucial to success in a world of rapid change. If you don’t currently have the aspiration, self-awareness, curiosity, and vulnerability to be an effective learner, these simple tools can help you get there.</p>
