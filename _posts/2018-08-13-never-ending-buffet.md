We need to limit, and diversify the amount, and quality of the media we consume.

"Garbage in garbage out" is a phrase we use when we refer to what we eat but not one we typically use when we discuss what we read, watch, and think. Most of the content we consume can be thought of as junk food. Quick, vapid articles that give us a hit of dopamine, just enough for us to continue on to the next BuzzFeed article. If we are to do the best work of our lives, than shouldn't our minds be in the best shape of our lives? After all, it's the muscle we use the most when we are at work. But what would that look like?

<h3> Limit the junk food: </h3>

I have a confession, I am a reddit junkie. Itâ€™s the first thing I look at when I wake up, and the last when I go to bed. It literally represents the best and worst of humanity at the same time. It's a microcosm of the human experience and this roller coaster of emotion is what got me hooked. But overtime I noticed two things, I was constantly refreshing the site, looking for new content and stories to read and I was getting sadder by the day. What I came to realize about our hyper connected world is I began to worry incessantly. War, drought, you name it, I was in a perpetual state of stress as I began to worry about things I could not possibly hope to control. And so, with a heavy heart, I deleted the reddit app from my phone. I still go on the site, but not as frequently as I used to and when I do, it's for a specific purpose.

<h3> Increase quality: </h3>

This is the equivalent of eating your fruits and veggies . If you are getting most of your information from the same sources, and people, how are you going to change how you think, or come up with new ideas? One of my favorite quotes is: "To go where you've never been, you must do what you've never done". Find books, articles, blogs, and people that force you to question how and what you think. This is by no means easy, in fact, it is probably one of the hardest things you can do. Our brains are wired to find the path of least resistance. This is why it is so hard to change people's minds. Once our brain accepts something as fact, it's very hard to convince it otherwise, even if it's proven false. But having the ability to hold two opposing ideas in your head is not only the mark of intelligence, but the mark of a great leader.
Diversify your brain food:

Once I stopped reading reddit, I branched out and started reading things from all different viewpoints and sources. I began to branch out to websites and books that covered Science, Art, and Business. Filling your mind with new ideas and topics from a variety of industries can help lead to novel breakthroughs at work and teach you different ways of tackling problems that might have otherwise been inconceivable.

Here are some great sources of information that I look to for inspiration. Note, this list is by no means exhaustive, this should just act as a starting point.
